= Our Philosophy =

We strive to create code that runs efficiently and without bugs. Well-written plugins are few and far between. While there are plenty of plugins that look nice, many of those plugins, including the "cool shiny ones" have hidden problems. Over 90% of the plugins available on the WordPress plugin directory generate dozens, if not hundreds, of warnings and errors when you turn off the "hide all the problems" (WP_DEBUG) settings.

These hidden problems impact memory usage, fill up disk space, and reduce performance. While you may not see the errors on your WordPress site, they are still being tracked. The more errors, the more disk I/O, the slower the app.

We have found that leaving "innocuous" warnings in place tends to lead to trouble further down the road. Warnings today often become errors tomorrow. Many programming languages, PHP included, continue to tighten security and close loopholes that are typically found living near warning messages. Some warnings are telling you to "change this now, it will be gone tomorrow". Eventually tomorrow will come.

We try to make sure that all the hidden stuff you don't see is designed as well as it can be. When we do hear about a bug we fix it fast.

We like to write plugins that last. We hope you appreciate our work.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Privacy Policy =

By using Store Locator Plus® on your website you should incorporate the following on your site:
[Third Party Site’s Use of Store Locator Plus® Privacy Policy](https://www.storelocatorplus.com/third-party-sites-use-of-store-locator-plus-privacy-policy/)

By default the Store Locator Plus® plugin does NOT have geolocation detection and will not ask for your user's latitude and longitude.
Location services are available via the [Store Locator Plus® SaaS Service](https://my.storelocatorplus.com/) on the Professional or Enterprise level.

By default the Store Locator Plus® plugin does NOT record location searches or other data when using the maps.
You CAN enable that tracking with the reporting feature in the [Store Locator Plus® SaaS Service](https://my.storelocatorplus.com/) on the Professional or Enterprise level.

= What are the Add Ons? =

Add ons extend the functionality of the plugin beyond the basic service and features and can be purchased ala-carte.
This gives those customers who want more out of the plugin the extra features they desire while keeping the main plugin as
efficient as possible for everyone else.   It also provides a great way to support future development while getting a
"little something extra" when contributing to the development of the product.

All plugins are true add-on packs.  They are non-destructive OPTIONAL additions to the base plugin.
They do not require the base plugin to be uninstalled or re-installed.
Installing an add-on pack will not change location data or modify base plugin settings.

= What is the Store Locator Plus® SaaS (MySLP)? =

[Store Locator Plus® SaaS](https://storelocatorplus.com/) is our hosted software-as-a-service for Store Locator Plus®.   We install the software on our servers where you will [login to manage locations](https://dashboard.storelocatorplus.com/) and setup the locator user experience via the map settings.  This is a paid monthly service and includes all Google Map fees.  It is NOT required to use the WordPress plugins.

= What is the difference between Store Locator Plus® SaaS and the WordPress plugins? =

[Store Locator Plus® SaaS](https://storelocatorplus.com/) requires no downloads or software installation.   With [Store Locator Plus® SaaS](https://storelocatorplus.com/) you are given a small JavaScript snippet that you can put on any web page -- not just WordPress sites.  For sites that have a more than 8,000 map views, our Store Locator Plus® SaaS overage rates are 20% less than Google's API direct billing.

The [Store Locator Plus WordPress plugins](https://storelocatorplus.com/) are downloadable zip files that you install on your self-managed WordPress site.  The base plugin is free.  The add ons are paid , but once you purchase and install them you own them.   You are responsible for keeping them updated and making sure the web hosting plan you are using can handle the technical requirements.  You must also setup and manage your own Google API Keys and have a credit card on file with Google.  They will bill you based on how many map views and address lookups you ask them to handle.

= What are the terms of the license? =

The license is GPL. Learn more on the [License Terms page](https://wordpress.storelocatorplus.com/products/general-eula/).

= How can I translate the plugin into my language? =

Store Locator Plus® is now part of the WordPress Translate system.

You can translate this readme file and the text strings in the main Store Locator Plus® plugin at [Translate.WordPress.Org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/store-locator-le).

For the Add Ons, the language files are distributed with each add-on pack.
If you translate an Add On send the .po and .mo files to support@storelocatorplus.com.

= How do I report a problem? =
